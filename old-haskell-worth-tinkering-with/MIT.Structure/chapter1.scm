;; Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose
;; operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the
;; behavior of the following procedure:
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

;; The body of the function takes the form:
;; ( (expression that evaluates to a function) a b)
;; ... and the value of the expression is either + or -, such that we always
;; add the absolute value of b to a.

;; Ben Bitdiddle defines the following procedures...

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

;; He then evaluates the expression (test 0 (p)).
;; What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses
;; applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an
;; interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? ...

;; alexr: In the applicative-order case, the interpreter should freeze up and
;; not return any value at all; in order to evaluate the expression (test 0
;; (p)), we would find the value of each part of the expression first --
;; yielding, in order, a procedure, 0... and a tail-recursive infinite loop.

;; The normal-order case (** XXX: is this the same as lazy evaluation, like in
;; Haskell? Or is it like thunks and call-by-name? Or are these the same
;; thing?
;; **) would expand out the expression to be (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)), and evaluate
;; out to 0, never jumping into the infinite tail recursion.

;; Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why /if/ needs to be provided as a special
;; form...

(define (sqrt-new-if x)
  (sqrt-iter-new-if 1.0 x))

;; Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square root program:
(define (sqrt-iter-new-if guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter-new-if (improve guess x)
                             x)))
;; What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots?

;; alexr: Eva Lu Ator has good intentions, but until we figure out how to use
;; the macro system (Scheme has a macro system, yes? We could write this in
;; Common Lisp macros, anyway) our expressions still get evaluated in
;; applicative order, including this function new-if. This means that when we
;; evaluate, for example, (sqrt-iter 1 25), all three arguments to new-if are
;; evaluated. Thus, irrespective of whether the guess is good enough, we will
;; recursively call sqrt-iter again with an improved guess. So with new-if,
;; sqrt-iter will never return (but it shouldn't blow the stack, either, being
;; tail-recursive.)

;;;; 1.7
;; The /good-enough?/ test used in computing square roots will not be very
;; effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real
;; computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited
;; precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain
;; these statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and
;; large numbers. An alternative strategy for implementing /good-enough?/ is
;; to watch how /guess/ changes from one iteration to the next and to stop
;; when the change is a very small faction of the guess. Design a square-root
;; procedure that uses this kind of test. Does this work better for small and
;; large numbers?
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (print guess)
  (newline)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)

;(define (sqrt x)
; (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

;; alexr: Well, in the case of small numbers, once we're working at a small
;; enough order of magnitude, all numbers will be marked as Good Enough. For
;; example, the square root of 1e-20 is really 1e-10. But 0.01 (eg, 1e-2) is
;; marked by /good-enough?/ as an acceptable approximation of its sqrt -- at 8
;; orders of magnitude off. (sqrt 1e-20) is calculated as 0.03125, with our
;; current code.

;; alexr: For very large numbers, the problem deals with the floating-point
;; representation of numbers in the computer -- they aren't
;; arbitrary-precision. Particularly, in the case of trying to compute the
;; sqrt of 3e20, the procedure (on mzscheme on amd64, anyway) quickly
;; converges 17320508075.688774, which is pretty close to the sqrt of 3e20,
;; but not good-enough, as such. Importantly, the improve function doesn't
;; move it at all; there are only so many bits to represent numbers any closer
;; to the actual sqrt. So in this case, the call never terminates...

;; The /smallest-divisor/ procedure shown at the start of this section does
;; lots of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible
;; by 2 there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger
;; even numbers. This suggests that the values used for test-divisor should not
;; be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this
;; change, define a procedure /next/ that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2
;; and otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the /smallest-divisor/
;; procedure to use (next test-divisor) instead of (+ test-divisor 1).  With
;; timed-prime-test incorporating this modified version of /smallest-divisor/,
;; run the test for each of the 12 primes found in exercise 1.22. Since this
;; modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run
;; about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the
;; observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain
;; the fact that it is different from 2?

;; alexr: Alright, let's make faster-smallest-divisor and friends. It seems
;; like, if we were really clever, we could have some way for /next/ to just
;; generate the list of prime numbers. But then, if we could build the list of

;; Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing
;; /expmod/. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute
;; exponentials, we could have simply written

;(define (expmod base exp m)
;  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

;; Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime
;; tester?  Explain.

;; lindseykuper: Alyssa's technique is correct and would return the same result
;; as our /expmod/, but the computation would be shaped differently.

;; The /fast-expt/ procedure (which Alyssa's technique uses) takes advantage of
;; the fact that, for even exp, base^exp = (base^(exp/2))^2.  It calculates the
;; two halves separately, then squares them and puts them back together to
;; calculate the final result, base^exp, before finding its remainder mod m.

;; Our /expmod/, on the other hand, never actually calculates base^exp.  It
;; turns out that, just as base^exp = (base^(exp/2))^2,
;; base^exp mod m = ((base^(exp/2) mod m)^2) mod m.  Not having to calculate
;; base^exp could be a big savings if exp is large.

;; To find out how big of a savings, let's build some test infrastructure, then
;; try using /expmod/ and /alyssa-expmod/ with some big values of exp.  Say,
;; 400,000, 500,000 and 600,000, for instance.

;; 15 steps, this way!  These steps don't necessarily take equal time, though.

;; /alyssa-expmod/ for large values of ex.  If we dug deeper, we might be able

;; Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 1.24.  His
;; /fast-prime?/ test seems to run more slowly than his /prime?/ test.  Louis
;; calls his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help.  When they examine Louis's code,
;; they find that he has written the /expmod/ procedure to use an explicit
;; multiplication, rather than calling /square/:

;(define (expmod base exp m)
;  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
;        ((even? exp)
;         (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
;                       (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
;                    m))
;        (else
;         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
;                    m))))

;; "I don't see what difference that could make," says Louis.  "I do," says
;; Eva. "By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the 0(log n)
;; process into a 0(n) process."  Explain.

;; lindseykuper: The expression

; (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))

;; will take longer to evaluate than the expression

; (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))

;; because of applicative-order evaluation.  The /*/ and /square/ procedures
;; evaluate their arguments before applying, so in the first case,
;; (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) gets calculated twice.  This is especically
;; inefficient because it's a recursive call to /expmod/, so our procedure
;; generates two identical recursive processes!

;; So, we know Louis' procedure is slower.  But why is it specifically O(n)
;; now, instead of O(log n)?  Well, we're still dividing exp by 2 in every
;; step, so it still takes (log n) steps to get to the bottom of the recursion
;; tree.  But with Louis' version, the number of times we have to perform the
;; same computation increases by powers of 2 with each step down the tree!  
;; So, the (log n) and the (n^2) "cancel out", in a sense, leaving us with
;; O(n) for the whole thing.  Ouch.

;    (kernel 0 0)))

;; but I don't know how to calculate the /so-far/ part with this continued
;; fraction thing -- the terms don't stand by themselves!

;; Let's think about this.  Suppose that all the n_i are, say, 3, and the d_i
;; are, say, 5.If /k/ = 1, then the answer is just

;; n_1
;; ---
;; d_1

;; Pretty simple -- 3/5.  Now, suppose /k/ = 2:

;;    n_1
;; ---------
;;       n_2
;; d_1 + ---
;;       d_2

;; (or n_1 / ((d_1 * d_2) + n_2) * 1/d_2.)

;; The first version of /cont-frac/ gives us:

; > (cont-frac (lambda (i) 3.0) (lambda (i) 5.0) 2)
; 0.5357142857142857

;; This is 3 / (5 + 3/5).  So it's what we had before but with n_2/d_2 added

;;          n_2
;; d_1 + ----------
;;              n_3
;;       d_2 +  ---

; > (cont-frac (lambda (i) 3.0) (lambda (i) 5.0) 3)
; 0.5419354838709678

;; This time it's 3 / (5 + 3/(5 + 3/5)).

;; I'm thinking that we need to calculate n_k/d_k first, and add that to
;; /so-far/.  If k = 1, we're done.  Otherwise, we add d_(k - 1) to what's in
;; /so-far/, divide n_(k - 1) by it, and push all that onto /so-far/, and it
;; becomes the new denominator.  Let's try it:

(define cont-frac-iter
  (lambda (n d k)
    (define kernel
      (lambda (i so-far)
        (if (= i 1)
            so-far
            (kernel (- i 1) (/ (n (- i 1)) (+ (d (- i 1)) so-far))))))
    (kernel k (/ (n k) (d k)))))

;; This seems to work on our test numbers:

; > (cont-frac-iter (lambda (i) 3.0) (lambda (i) 5.0) 1)
; 0.6
; > (cont-frac-iter (lambda (i) 3.0) (lambda (i) 5.0) 2)
; 0.5357142857142857

;; It also works on the approximation of 1/phi from part a:

; > (cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0) (lambda (i) 1.0) 11)
; 0.6180555555555556
; > (cont-frac-iter (lambda (i) 1.0) (lambda (i) 1.0) 11)
; 0.6180555555555556

;; Yay!

;; Aside: my implementation above was directly translated from English, but it
;; might be more stylish (or less ridiculous) to do it this way:

(define cont-frac-iter-alternate-version
  (lambda (n d k)
    (define kernel
      (lambda (i so-far)
        (if (= i 0)
            so-far
            (kernel (- i 1) (/ (n i) (+ (d i) so-far))))))
    (kernel k 0)))
