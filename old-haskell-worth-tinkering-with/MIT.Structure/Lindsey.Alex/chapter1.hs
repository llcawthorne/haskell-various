---- 1.2
-- Translate the following expression into prefix form.
--
-- The Scheme looks like this:
-- (define (one-point-two)
--   (/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 4/5))))
--      (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7))))

onepointtwo_prefix = (/) ((+) ((+) 5 4) ((-) 2 ((-) 3 ((+) 6 ((/) 4 5)))))
                          ((*) ((*) 3 ((-) 6 2)) ((-) 2 7))

-- Or, more naturally in Haskell:
top = (5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + 4/5))))
bottom = (3 * (6 - 2) * (2 - 7))
onepointtwo = top / bottom

---- 1.3
-- Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns
-- the sum of squares of the two larger numbers.

square x = x * x
sum_of_squares a b = square a + square b

ss_of_largest_two a b c
  | (a < b) && (a < c) = sum_of_squares b c
  | (b < a) && (b < c) = sum_of_squares a c

-- else --
ss_of_largest_two a b c = sum_of_squares a b

---- 1.4
-- Going ahead and writing a-plus-abs-b in Haskell.
a_plus_abs_b a b = (if (b > 0) then (+) else (-)) a b

-- 1.5
---- Ben Bitdiddle defines the following procedures...

p = p
test x y = if (x == 0) then 0 else y

-- He then evaluates the expression (test 0 (p)).

-- alexr: In this case, Haskell's lazy evaluation just returns 0. Since x is 0,
-- we don't need to bother finding out what the value of running p is. (it does
-- turn out to be an infinite loop if you run it on its own)

---- 1.6
-- Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why /if/ needs to be provided as a special
-- form...

new_if predicate then_clause else_clause =  
  case predicate of
    True -> then_clause
    False -> else_clause

-- (previously defined functions, needed here)
improve guess x = average guess (x / guess)

average x y = (x + y) / 2

good_enough guess x =
  (abs ((square guess) - x)) < 0.001

sqrt_new_if x = sqrt_iter_new_if 1.0 x

sqrt_iter_new_if guess x =
  new_if (good_enough guess x)
         guess
         (sqrt_iter_new_if (improve guess x) x)

-- alexr: In Haskell, if can be just a regular function. This all works fine
-- because of lazy evaluation. Whereas in an eager language like Scheme, both
-- arguments to the "if" function would get evaluated (and we'd never decide
-- that the approximation is "good enough"), in Haskell, we don't bother
-- evaluating the "sqrt_iter_new_if" branch unless we need it.
-- new_if does differ slightly from regular if in that its syntax doesn't have
-- a "then" built in. How would you define that, one wonders? Are there macros
-- for Haskell?

---- 1.12
-- ... Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means
-- of a recursive process.

pascals 0 0 = 1

pascals _ 0 = 1

pascals row col
  | (col == row) = 1

pascals row col
  | (col <= row) = (pascals (row - 1) (col - 1)) + (pascals (row - 1) col)
